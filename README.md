#Presentation

This project is a maze solver. It's goal is to apply basic OOP programming and data structures.

#Features

Left click to select a box (or unselect it if it was already selected).
Right click to directly change an empty box to a wall or vice versa.
You can then change the box type at will with the differents buttons once it is selected.
Once you have a start and a goal, you can try to find a path between them.

You can create a maze of any size as long as it is rectangular.

You can also save and load mazes for future use.
